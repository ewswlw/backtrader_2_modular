- using LSTM (pytorch not tensorflow) to develop the best timing strategy possible on cad_ig_er_index that outperforms the buy and hold version of it....using patterns between the target and the other data in the columns
- at every step use print statements for debugging and output interpretation
- interpret the output and try to make sense of it in great detail
- make sure all printed statements are clear and easy to understand and nicely formatted
- try to make the code as readable as possible with detailed comments
- optimize the code to ensure that nothing ever runs for longer than 5 minutes
