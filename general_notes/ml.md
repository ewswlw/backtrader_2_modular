Ensure that each iteration builds upon the previous one, leveraging past insights to drive improvements.

7. Time-Series Specific Instructions (If Applicable)
If the DataFrame pertains to time-series data for algorithmic trading, incorporate the following considerations:

Data Splitting:
Split data based on time (e.g., train on historical data, test on more recent data) to prevent leakage.
Lag Features:
Create lagged versions of key features to capture temporal dependencies (e.g., price_t-1, volume_t-2).
Rolling Statistics:
Compute rolling means, standard deviations, or other window-based statistics as features.
Avoiding Data Leakage:
Ensure that no future information is used in training by carefully designing feature engineering steps.
Example Code Snippet for Time-Series Feature Engineering:

python
Execute
Copy Code
# Create lag features for 'Price'
df['Price_Lag1'] = df['Price'].shift(1)
df['Price_Lag2'] = df['Price'].shift(2)

# Create rolling mean for 'Volume'
df['Volume_RollingMean_3'] = df['Volume'].rolling(window=3).mean()

# Drop initial rows with NaN values after shifting
df = df.dropna()

# Define features and target after feature engineering
X = df.drop('Target', axis=1)
y = df['Target']
Explanation:

Lag Features: Capture the previous time steps' Price to help the model understand trends.
Rolling Mean: Smooths the Volume data over a window of 3 periods to identify patterns.
Dropping NaNs: Removes rows that have missing values due to shifting operations to maintain data integrity.
8. Final Notes
